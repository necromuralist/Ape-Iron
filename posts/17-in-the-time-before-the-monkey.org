In the time of boar and Monkey,
When Death became a painter,
Love forgot its mother's name,
And new memories burn fainter.

Sitting on the front porch,
Eating screaming greens,
We sang a song of six-fingers,
In unkown Cantonese.

Down on the mountain,
Riding to the Top,
Father rode side-saddle,
The Other rode to crop.

Covid came for cannabis,
And stayed around for meth,
Our planet burned around us,
While Juniors breathed out death.

The rage didn't kill us,
It had no monopoly,
I watched it all through opaque glass,
Looking out for me.

Still the Rabbit sits backwards-look-away
Muttering her grumbles,
Through her dark of day,
And the Spiders sing around my head - 
"We will never go away."
