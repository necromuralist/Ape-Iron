* Steps
0. Start with your characters from {{% doc %}}character-jam{{% /doc %}}.
1. Prepare 16 panels with caption boxes
2. Find four characters on your Drawing Jam page that you'd like to work on for the next half an hour.
3. Copy each of them into the first chamber of each row (so distribute the four characters over four rows)
4. Leave the caption areas blank
5. Draw each character three more times, filling the row (vary each drawing a little bit (or a lotta bit))
   - Try to think what is the right next panel given what's been filled in already
   - Spend about a minute per panel.
   
Add details.
