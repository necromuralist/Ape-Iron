* The Book
The product page for the book points to the older version of the book.

- Nature of Code [Internet]. [cited 2023 May 11]. Available from: https://natureofcode.com

The version I'm looking at is the second edition which uses p5.js.

- https://nature-of-code-2nd-edition.netlify.app/ : the hosted book
- https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-book-2023: the repository for the book
- https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-examples-p5.js: The p5.js version of the examples in the book(s)

  Daniel Shiffman also has a website called [[https://thecodingtrain.com/][the Coding Train]] with videos about programming. There is a Nature of Code "track" (https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/the-nature-of-code-2) but it only goes part of the way through chapter 1.
