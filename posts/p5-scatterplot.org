The "rando-5000.csv" is a subset of citi-bike data used to illustrate [[https://github.com/CenterForSpatialResearch/dataviz_tutorials/blob/master/04_WorkingWithData_p5js.md][WorkingWithData_p5.js]].

* Setup

** Import

#+begin_src python :results none
# python
from functools import partial

# pypi
from tabulate import tabulate
import pandas
#+end_src

#+begin_src python :results none
TABLE = partial(tabulate,
                headers="keys",
                tablefmt="orgtbl",
                showindex=False)
#+end_src

* Rando 5000

This file comes from the "Center For Spatial Research's" tutorial on github. The file contains data about trips taken using Citi Bikes in New York City in October 2017. For the tutorial they took a random sample of the trips from October 10, 2017 where a year of birth was given for the rider.

#+begin_src python :results none
data = pandas.read_csv("/media/irvin/datasets/bike-sharing/rando-5000.csv",
                       index_col=0)
#+end_src

** The Columns

for column in sorted(data.columns):
