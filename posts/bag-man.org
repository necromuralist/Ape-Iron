* The Bag Man
  This post was created to see what happens in the slideshow if you put all the image files in the =images= folder without sub-folders, it's a companion to the {{% doc %}}image-testing{{% /doc %}} post.
  
    #+ATTR_HTML: :alt Bag Man
    #+ATTR_HTML: :class reference
    [[file:../../images/bag-man.webp][file:../../images/bag-man.thumbnail.png]]

* The Bag Man Without Thumbnails
  If you want to just display the image they recommend you put it in the =files= folder, but you can still reference it in the images folder too, but as with the thumbnails you need to use a more common format like png. This org-reference:

#+begin_example org
    [[file:../../images/bag-man.png]]
#+end_example

Will include this image.
