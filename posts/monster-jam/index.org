* Steps
1. Divide your drawing area into quarters.
2. Make a scribble in each of the quarters.
3. Set a timer for two minutes and turn one of the scribbles into a monster.
   - Repeat for the remainder of the panels.
4. Write four complete sentences:
   - Something you have to do
   - A line you have memorized from a poem or song
   - A question you have been wondering about
   - A specific command given by a king or queen
5. Decide which monster is saying each of the sentences and add them as speech bubbles to the drawings.
