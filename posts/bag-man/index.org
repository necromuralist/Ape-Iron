* The Bag Man
  This post was created to see what happens in the slideshow if you put all the image files in the =images= folder without sub-folders, it's a companion to the {{% doc %}}image-testing{{% /doc %}} post.
  
{{% thumbnail "/images/bag-man.webp" alt="Bag-Man With Purse-Dog" %}}{{% /thumbnail %}}

* The Bag Man Without Thumbnails
  If you want to just display the image they recommend you put it in the =files= folder, but you can still reference it in the images folder too, but you need to be aware of the fact that the folder path has to change. This org-reference:

#+begin_example org
    [[img-url:../../images/bag-man.webp]]
#+end_example

Will include this (full-sized) image (**note:** The path to the images folder is based on where the post is, if the post was in a subfolder you'd have to go up three directories, not two).

    #+ATTR_HTML: :alt Bag Man Big

* Bag-Man Re-Crafted
  This was a tracing of the bag man onto kraft paper to mess around with gouache.
