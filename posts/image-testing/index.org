* Thumbnail With Baguette Box  
  This is a look at using an [[https://getnikola.com/handbook.html#embedding-images][embedded image]] from the =images= folder. If you put the files in the =images= folder then it automatically creates thumbnails and a slide-show, but there's a little trick to getting the folder references right. 

** HTML   
   If you use HTML you can just assume that the =images= folder is at the root of the site (make sure to set the class to "reference").

#+begin_example html
<a class="reference" href="/images/eyeball-man.webp" alt="Eyeball Man"><img src="/images/eyeball-man.thumbnail.webp"></a>
#+end_example
   
#+begin_export html
<a class="reference" href="/images/eyeball-man.webp" alt="Eyeball Man"><img src="/images/eyeball-man.thumbnail.webp"></a>
#+end_export
** The Thumbnail Shortcode
   It took me a while to stumble upon this, but there is an ~image~ shortcode for those of us not using ReST (although it isn't directly linked to in the documentation for the ReST directive, from what I could tell). So if you want to do it the easier way:

 - Put the original image in the ~images~ folder
 - use the shortcode:

{{% raw %}}{{% thumbnail "/images/eyeball-man.webp" alt="Eyeball Man" title="Eyeball Man" %}}{{% /thumbnail %}}{{% /raw %}}

To get a thumbnail which will produce a pop-up to the original image when it's clicked.

{{% thumbnail "/images/eyeball-man.webp" alt="Eyeball Man" %}}{{% /thumbnail %}}
* More Notes
  * The =alt= attribute adds a title to the images in the slide show
  * Nikola builds the slideshow from all the images on the page. So if you only have one post open, it will show the post's images, but if you are in the blog-post index and there's more than one post shown, it will pick up the images from all the posts.
