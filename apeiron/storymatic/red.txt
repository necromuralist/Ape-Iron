awkward hug
burning house
car accident 
caught!
class reunion
discovery of what's in the glove box
family curse
family member reincarnated as a parrot
fever
grandmother's ashes
greedy relatives
historical re-creation goes awry
ice
interview
invisibility
invitation from a stranger
lost all identification
medicine isn't working
memory of a kiss
one half of a ripped love letter
one-way plane ticket
phone calls aren't returned
rest stop
talent show
television is broadcasting actual memories
the sentence that changed everything
the story of the scar
