* Steps
 - Set a timer (5 minutes if you don't know how long)
 - Close your eyes and settle in
 - Focus on your breath
 - Let go of the breath and try one of these:
   + Just listen and if anything interesting comes up write it down
   + Ask a related question (e.g. "What do I need to know?", "What story can I tell?")
