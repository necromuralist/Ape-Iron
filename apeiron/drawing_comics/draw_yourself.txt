Surfing with a shark
riding an insect
climbing a rope
as a statue in a museum
as a cave person with a pal
as a lovely fountain
in the hospital
getting arrested
encounters with squirrel
doing something you would never do
as a bearded lady
escaping from jail
as conjoined twins
shooting out of a volcano
playing in a bad jazz band
eating fried chicken
dancing with a potato
being carried by an alien
in the deep deep sea
at the beauty parlor
as a viking
as the god of fire
in a marching band
as a French person
tunneling to freedom
tightrope walker
vomiting
running from a giant snowball
riding a bird
dancing sadly
as god of Spring
as a pirate
as a kid in a costume
with 3 cats
lost at sea
as a fry cook in love
