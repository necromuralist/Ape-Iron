The ordinary world
The call to adventure
The refusal of the call
Encouragement from the mentor
Crossing the first threshold to the other world
Tests, allies, enemies
Crossing the second threshold to the innermost cave
Enduring an ordeal
Claiming your reward
Being pursued on the return
Crossing the third threshold back to the ordinary world
Being resurrected and transformed
Sharing the reward with the ordinary world
